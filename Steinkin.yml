          - 'Steinkin are similar to constructs in that they do not require air, food, drink, or sleep. Instead, you have the following traits:'
          - type: list
            items:
              - You do not need to eat or drink. Instead you consume 1 pound of stone per day to maintain your health. If you do not consume stone, you suffer one level of {@condition exhaustion} per day after 24 hours.
              - You do not need to breathe air, but you can still suffer the effects of {@hazard suffocation} after 30 minutes plus your constitution bonus times 5 minutes, after which you become a statue and gain the {@condition incapacitated} condition. The only way to revive you from this state is to expend the magic of a spell of a level at least equal to that of your potential spell casting level.
              - You cannot swim and sink in water or liquid of similar viscosity.
              - You do not need to sleep. Instead, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you essentially become a statue and cannot awaken yourself or be awoken.
              - You may consume materials of higher rarity to heal yourself. Consuming a gemstone of uncommon rarity or higher heals you for {@dice 1d4} hit points per rarity level. Consuming a gemstone of common rarity or lower heals you for 1 hit point.

          - This unusual weapon consists of a pillar-shaped slab of Kinstone with a handle affixed to the side. The handle is attached through some kind of ratcheting mechanism, with a lever on the handle to release the ratcheting lock, allowing the tonfa to spin freely
          - Due to the heavy nature of the material used to make this weapon, wielding it is difficult. Creatures with a strength less than 18 roll to attack with disadvantage.
          - As this weapon is able to spin, the wielder may attempt an athletics check to make use of this and attack with additional momentum.
